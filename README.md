## Description
Lucy and Ed made this small app to showcase GIF fetches, webkit Speech Recognition, and human creativity. 


## Tech details
The app is made in React with no backend.

The HTML5 Speech Recognition API gives Javascript access to a browser's audio stream and converts it into text. Currently, this is only supported on Firefox and Chrome. 



## Accessibility
If you would like to make changes to this and input your poem in a different language, we recommend forking, cloning and changing the code to specify a language parameter with `whateverYouCalledYourSpeechVariable.lang`. For example, we've called ours `speech` so it looks like this: `speech.lang = "en-GB"`, as the default language is `en-US` but we weren't about that.
